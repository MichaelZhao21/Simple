# Simple Phone Desktop!

The point of this app is to simplify your phone desktop and ONLY have text as your app launchers. The goal is to reduce the likelihood of you clicking on your apps as there are no icons. I have found that this reduces my phone usage significantly, especially for those more addicitve doomscrolling apps.
